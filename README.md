# FNN
Fractal Neural Network - Ensemble of learned features and reshaping of fractal geometry-based descriptors

FractalFeatures.m - Extracts FD, LAC and PERC local and global features using three distance metrics from RGB images
reshapeRecPlot.m - Generates a recurrence plot reshape from the obtained local fractal features
plot_gaf.ipynb - Generates GADF and GASF reshapes from the obtained local fractal features
SaveCSVPercLACDF3Distances.m - Saves the obtained fractal features in a CSV file
